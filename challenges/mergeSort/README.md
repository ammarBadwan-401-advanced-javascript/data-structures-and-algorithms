# Code Challenge 27: Merge Sort

## Challenge

* Here we use the divide and conquer way, so we keep dividing the array until its 1 element each, then we sort it 1 by 1 and then merge them all back, implement it.

### Efficiency

* Time: O(n logn) because at it's worse, there will be a while loop and how many times the array is split.

* Space: O(n)  Because the memory allocated depends on how big the array itself is.
